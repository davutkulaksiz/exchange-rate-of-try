# exchange-rate-of-try
My first Flask project that dynamically gets currency rates of TRY and visualizes them as a website.
This is also my first project about back-end web development. I've previously designed a static website with Bootstrap but the back-end part was non-existent.

With this project I've learnt how to get data from APIs in realtime with JSON and how to visualize this data using front-end.
