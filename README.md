# Exchange Rates of Try
- My first **Flask project** that dynamically gets currency rates of TRY and visualizes them as a website.
- This is also my first project about back-end web development. I've previously designed a static website with Bootstrap but the back-end part was non-existent.
- With this project I've learnt how to get data from APIs in realtime with JSON and how to visualize this data using front-end.
